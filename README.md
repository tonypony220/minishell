# minishell
Implementation of simple shell with readline() instead of Termcaps. 
My part of this learning project involves executing commands and leading the development process.

This shell could: 
  - search in path PATH and execute 
  - execute builtins like: echo, cd, pwd, export, unset, env, exit without options
  - support separating command with ; 
  - redirect by < << >> > 
  - build pipes wiht | 
  - ctrl-C, ctrl-D, ctrl-\
  - $? 
  
Just make and run.
